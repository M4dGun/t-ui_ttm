## Features

Its main functions are:

* Install a theme chosen from those available
* show the list of available themes
* show theme previews, via GitHub
* backup your current theme
* restore the previous backup
* update the script and the list of available themes

## Prerequisites:
* [T-UI Expert](https://github.com/v1nc/T-UI-Expert/releases/download/v0.4.4e/de.reckendrees.systems.tui.expert_fdroid_v.0.4.4e.apk)
* TEL / Termux or Busybox (the script needs to access curl or wget to execute some commands)


## How to install

**Option 1: automatic download**
* Download [install_ttm.zip](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/raw/main/theme-manager/install_ttm.zip) and extract it into your internal storage ( /storage/emulated/0 ).
* On t-ui, change directory to the extracted folder if you are in a location other than the internal memory. 
* Then type `sh install_ttm.sh` and wait for installation to finish.
* When setup is done, `restart` or `refresh` t-ui.
* (Optional) If you can't install ttm via t-ui, you need to use Termux / TEL or another Terminal Emulator: remember to install curl or wget if they are not present.

<br>
NOTE: if you can't install ttm anyway, because you don't have root or because the script doesn't find curl or wget, install ttm manually<br>
<br>

**Option 2: manual download**
* Download [ttm script](https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes/raw/main/theme-manager/ttm.zip) and extract it into your internal storage ( /storage/emulated/0 ).
* On t-ui Expert type:
* `alias -file`
* add these 2 aliases at the bottom of the list
* `ttm=sh /storage/emulated/0/ttm %`
* `ttm -p=search -u https://github.com/M4dGun/t-ui_themes`
* Save file and `restart` or `refresh` t-ui.


## How to use 

[Work in Progress...]

#### You can use this script:<br>
1. Through T-ui Expert if you have root
2. Through T-ui Expert if you can use curl or wget without "termux curl" and/or "termux wget" commands
3. Via Termux or TEL or another terminal emulator and with or without root (remembering to install curl or wget if not present)

* Case 1: if you are rooted then export Termux/TEL user bin folder into the PATH from T-UI:

`export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets && su -c tsu`
      
Now you can use all commands of Termux bin folder from T-UI. <br>

**Important:** *Do not restart t-ui after running this command.*<br>
This needs to be done for every session like if TUI Expert app re-launchs or the phone is rebooted etc.. so add an alias called init, type:<br>
`alias -file` <br>
Copy and paste this command at the end of file:<br>
`init=export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets && su -c tsu` <br>
Save and refresh t-ui Expert. 
When you reboot your device or restart t-ui just type `init`.

TEST IT: type `curl --help`
